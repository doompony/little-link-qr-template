## Sales Pitch

Problem: You want a simple website to serve as a one-stop shop for all the
links related to you - YouTube, Patreon, Venmo, Show Calendar, etc. You'd also
like a kick-awesome QR Code for your followers to simply scan and be brought to
that site... But you aren't sure where to start!

I can help solve your problem with varying degrees of cost/support. However,
before outlining my offerings, let me explain each piece to the solution.

First you need a webpage with the links. At the end of the day this boils down
to just being a folder with some files and pictures in it. If you had this
folder on your computer, you could open it up in a web browser like Google
Chrome and click around like a regular website (example: https://1man1band.com).

My primary offering is to build that web page. I charge $100 for building it
and then I'll happily hand it off to you to handle hosting...

What is hosting? Well, you have the webpage as files, but now you want to put
it on the internet. This requires a few things and I'll work backwards with
them. First you need a webserver to actually serve up the files. The main file
is called `index.html` and you can use your computer and open up the
`index.html` file with a web browser. However, the URL will be something like
`C://Users/YourName/Documents/MyWebsite/index.html` and if that's where the
website is being hosted from, then no one else can open it up unless they're
literally logged into your computer... That's where a web server comes in -
it's a specific thing that hosts your website so others can get to it on
the internet.

> As far as my offerings go - I will manage hosting your site via GitHub pages
> for between $50/year and $100/year... it depends on the next part of the
> solution.

Once you have a webserver figured out (in my case usually it'll be GitHub Pages
as a service) then you need a way for people to find it - ie. a link/URL.

Shared hosting on my GitHub pages:

> With GitHub Pages, for $50/year I can support the following link
> `https://doompony.github.io/YOUR-LINK`. The only charge associated with this
> will be the annual fee for me to look after and monitor the site's uptime.

Dedicated GitHub pages domain:

> Supposing you don't want `doompony` in the link (understandable) then for
> $100/year I can find a slightly more custom link. As an example:
> `https://1man1band.github.io/littlelink`, and I will still monitor the site's
> uptime.

In either of those cases I'm happy to be available for small edits, with larger
edits being subject to a service charge.

Now... suppose you don't want the `github.io` in the link at all, and you want
something totally custom, for example `https://1man1band.com`. In that case you
have to actually own the `domain`. A domain contains two parts - the TLD (top
level domain) and hostname. In this example the TLD is `.com` and the
hostname is `1man1band`. There are several TLDs to choose from (`.com`,
`.net`, `.io`, `.dev`, `.xyz` just to name a few). You can purchase a domain
through a service like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com), and there is an
annual renewal fee (sometimes you can multiple years at a discount). Purchasing
the domain is not enough for someone to type it into their web browser and have
your little link site load up though - you have to setup DNS for that.
This process is much more complicated than I can put into this document, and if
you want to do it yourself you'll have a lot of fun and also plenty to learn.

> As part of my services I can help you purchase a domain and setup the DNS so
> that you have a nice link like [1man1band.com](https://www.1man1band.com). I
> charge a $200 setup fee for assisting with the domain purchase and DNS setup,
> and then $100/annually to monitor and site and ensure the link is regularly up.
